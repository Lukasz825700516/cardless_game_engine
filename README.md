# cardless game engine

Cardless is next generation of #[cardboard game engine](https://github.com/Lukasz825700516/cardboard_game_engine)!

## Why rewrote in rust

Compile times were too short, so I decided to extend them with with Rust programing language.


## Will Cardless have more things than Cardboard?

I have no idea, but I will try ~~to not abandon the project until it has working gui that can spawn some game objects.~~
